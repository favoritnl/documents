## CommonMark

From 2012, a group of people including Jeff Atwood and John MacFarlane launched what Atwood characterized as a standardization effort.[(go to doc1)](/doc1.md) A community website now aims to "document various tools and resources available to document authors and developers, as well as implementors of the various markdown implementations".[26] In September 2014, Gruber objected to the usage of "Markdown" in the name of this effort and it was rebranded as a new dialect named CommonMark.[27][28] CommonMark.org published several versions of a specification, reference implementation, and test suite, and "[plans] to announce a finalized 1.0 spec and test suite in 2018."[29]
